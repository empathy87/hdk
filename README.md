# From NAND to Tetris: Part 2

This project is an implementation of the second part of the
"From NAND to Tetris" course, which aims to teach computer
science from the ground up by building a complete,
working computer system from basic logic gates.
This project covers the software side of the computer
system, including assembler, virtual machine, the operating
system and the compiler.
